## Tensorflow Implementation of VGAN Models

This repository is some personal practice in building neural networks from scratch based off of existing models. Attached in the src folder are the generator, discriminator, and encoder networks detailed in **Generating Videos with Scene Dynamics** from MIT and Columbia. While this version does not have scripts for training, it does include the networks which can be trained in whichever manner you find fit.
